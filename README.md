## Introduction

Malaria is a major infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. Early detection plays a crucial role in reducing mortality rates, especially in high-risk groups. This project focuses on developing a prototype that utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Yolov5, and the Roboflow utility framework for accurate and real-time classification of Plasmodium species from thin smear images.

## Methods

The research methodology involved information and data gathering, data processing, and result evaluation. Relevant information was obtained through literature studies, while the dataset containing 103 thin smear images of malaria patients was sourced from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The dataset included positive images for various Plasmodium species.

Data processing involved image annotation using the Roboflow framework, creating classes for different Plasmodium species. The annotated dataset was then split into training, validation, and testing sets. The Yolov5 detection program was built using Google Collaboratory and Python programming language, with different Yolov5 models evaluated.

The evaluation process compared model performance based on metrics such as mean average precision (mAP), inference time, and other relevant factors to determine the most effective model for Plasmodium detection.

## Conclusion

This research presents a prototype that assists healthcare workers in diagnosing Plasmodium species with high specificity, sensitivity, and real-time capability. By employing deep learning techniques with Yolov5 and the Roboflow utility framework, the automatic classification of Plasmodium species from thin smear images becomes feasible. The results contribute to the development of a more efficient and effective malaria diagnosis process.
